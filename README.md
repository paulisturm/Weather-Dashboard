# Weather-Dashboard

Users will be able to search for the current weather conditions in the city of their choice. That city will then be added to the search history. When the user searches for the city, they will be presented with the city name, the date and icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed. Users will also be presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the weather conditions.
